   An action  is something that will be done by the bot and returned to the user as the result.
    
   **Actions** are triggered by:

   1. Inline Buttons
   2. Keyboard buttons
   3. User-input
   4. Phone Calls
 
   Actions may trigger **Redux's reducers**  to update **Topic** so that bot will know in what context to process next  input made by user.
